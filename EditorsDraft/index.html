    <section id='abstract'>
This specification introduces a common data model that supports the publication of 
information about opportunities for people to engage in physical activities ("opportunity data"). 

The model covers description of activities, as well as the events and locations in 
which they take place. The specification is intended to support the publication 
of opportunity data as open data for anyone to access, use and share. It will also guide reusers 
of opportunity data, introducing them to the key concepts relevant to that sector.

The model may also be useful in guiding the development of both new and existing booking 
systems and applications that consume opportunity data.

The specification is an output of the [Openactive Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/openactive/) 
and serves as a common reference point for other specifications and outputs of that activity.

The data model introduced in this document has been mapped to existing standards and vocabularies, including 
SKOS ([[SKOS]]) and the Schema.org ([[SCHEMA-ORG]]) types and properties. 

This existing work provides a useful existing framework around which the 
[Openactive Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/openactive/) can build custom data standards.
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'>
The purpose of this document is to represent an early draft to prompt feedback. 
It will evolve based on discussion within the community.

Contributions to this document are not only welcomed but are actively solicited and 
should be made via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues)

# Introduction

The [W3C Openactive Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/openactive/) was 
established with the objective of facilitating the sharing and use of 
physical activity data. This data is currently largely closed. Open publishing of this 
data has enormous potential to increase people's participation in physical activities.

## Categories of Physical Activity Data

There are several different categories of data that relevant to physical activities. 
This data covers different parts of [the data spectrum](http://theodi.org/data-spectrum) 
and is represented in the following diagram.

    <figure>
      ![](images/opportunity-data.png)
      <figcaption>Types of physical activity data</figcaption>
    </figure>

Some of this data is shared data. It can only be accessed by 
specific people or groups, under terms and conditions that define how and when 
it can be accessed and used. This shared data includes personal data about 
people taking part in activities and participation data that describes how people have 
been involved in previous events. 

Some of this data can be open data. Open data is data that anyone can access, use and share. 
All of the following types of data can be published as open data:

* descriptions and lists of physical activities 
* details of the locations and venues at which activities or events takes plac
* the facilities available at those locations
* the details of event involving physical activities e.g. when and where they will take place, restrictions 
on attendance, costs, etc
* any related information, e.g. about the format of the event, its organiser, etc

Collectively this is known as __*opportunity data*__.

## Scope

This specification defines a data model for opportunity data. This reflects the 
goal of [the OpenActive project](https://www.openactive.io/) whose aim is to 
encourage the publishing and reuse of open data that might help people to become 
more active.

It is expected that the [Openactive Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/openactive/) 
will produce additional specifications that cover other aspects of achieving this 
goal, e.g. event bookings, etc.

## Structure of this document

This specification is divided into three main sections:

1. **Key Concepts** - describes the key types of resources relevant to opportunity data, along with their relationships and common attributes
2. **Data Model** - a data model that maps the key concepts to some standard vocabularies
3. **Worked Examples** - examples that illustrate how to use JSON-LD and the standard vocabularies to structure opportunity data

# Key Concepts

This section introduces the high-level data model for opportunity data. This includes a 
description of the:

* the resources that are relevant to opportunity data, e.g. places, events, activities, etc
* the relationships between those resources
* the main attributes that help to describe those resources, e.g. names, dates, etc

The model also helps to provide definitions of key terms that are used throughout this 
specification.

## Data Model Diagram

This diagram illustrates the resources and relationships that are introduced in the following sections.

    </figure>

## Physical Activities

A __*Physical Activity*__ is an exercise, sport or other form of bodily movement 
that involves physical effort. Physical activities will usually have a well-understood, 
dictionary definition.

Examples of Physical Activities include walking, running, cycling, rugby, football and tennis

Activities should have a name. They might also be associated with one of more synomyms 
that provide alternative names for that activity. E.g. "Soccer" is a synonym 
for "Football". This additional information may be useful to help improve search engines and 
improve data collection.

Physical Activities may also have additional information associated with them. 
For example a sporting activity might be overseen by an governing body or federation.

Physical Activities might also be recognised by different bodies. In the UK certain 
activities are recognised as suitable for educational assessments, while others 
may be recognised by funding bodies like Sport England.

An __*Activity List*__ describes a set of Physical Activities. An Activity List may be a 
simple list of activity names. But an Activity List might also capture additional information. 
A common requirement is to describe relationships between Physical Activities.

One method of grouping activities is to define "broader" and "narrower" relationships.
For example Judo, Karate and Kendo are all more specific examples of the broader activity of 
"Martial Arts".

 * Martial Arts
  * Karate
  * Kendo
  * Judo

This type of grouping could also be used to describe the disciplines associated with 
Physical Activities. For example olympic and open water swimming.

An Activity List might also group Physical Activities into collections. For example 
swimming, water aerobics, and water polo might all be classified as "Water Sports".
Water polo and football might also be grouped into a collection of "Team Sports".

 * Team Sports
  * Football
  * Water Polo
 * Water Sports
  * Swimming
  * Water Aerobics
  * Water Polo

An Activity List may include any number of collections of Physical Activities. As shown in the 
example above, an individual Physical Activity might be present in more than one grouping. 

Some systems may choose to use grouping and hierarchical relationships between 
Physical Activities to help people find opportunities to be active. For example 
a search engine might offer users results for all types of Martial Art, or for Karate specifically.

<div class="note">
It is not a requirement that systems store, publish or use relationships between 
Physical Activities. A system may choose to treat Physical Activities as simple tags 
or categories associated with Events. Other systems may define a fixed list of 
Physical Activities that are used as a controlled vocabulary to guides user input 
and data collection. Others may adopt a more complex hierarchical approach.
</div>

<div class="note">
This specification doesn't place any requirements on how applications manage 
or use Physical Activities or Activity Lists. There is no requirement that applications that 
implement this specification should adopt a single standardised list, 
or agree on standard groupings. The intention here is to just capture a useful model 
that can represent the variety of data currently in use. However there may be benefits to 
the physical activity sector in converging on a standard list of Physical Activities to 
improve discovery, reporting, etc.
</div>

<div class="note">
The proposed model for Activity Lists is based on the [[SKOS]] standard for publishing controlled 
vocabularies. See later section on [Controlled Vocabularies](#controlled-vocabularies).
</div>

## Events

An __*Event*__ is an opportunity to take part in a Physical Activity. Events take place at a 
specific location (see below) at an agreed date and time.

Some Events are one-off occurences. For example a fun run organised by a local group 
may run as a standalone event on a particular date. 

Other events take place on a regular __schedule__. For example a weekly gym class may 
run every Wednesday evening at 7pm. While a local walking club might meet on a Saturday 
morning once a month.

In order to simplify terminology we recommend the use of the term "Event" to 
refer to both individual occurences and regularly occuring events. 

<div class="note">
Where there is a need to disambiguate between individual and regularly occuring events in 
written documentation, we suggest using "session" to refer to an individual event taking 
place at a specific date and time. But this is suggested purely to improve discussion, sessions 
are not features of the model presented in this specification. 
</div>

An Event might occur on a specified __*schedule*__ whereas a Session will always take 
place at a specific date and time.

A weekly gym class provides a useful example of this distinction. There is an 
Event for the regular class meeting, which takes place on a regular schedule, e.g. every Tuesday evening. 
There is a specific session of that Event taking place next Tuesday at 6pm.

It is useful to publish data about both Events with schedules and individual Sessions. 
People looking for opportunities to be active will be interested in both specific questions 
("what can I do tomorrow") and more general information about scheduled activities.

Regardless of whether an event takes place only once or happens on a regular schedule, there 
is a range of additional information that may help describe the event to potential participants. 
This includes:

* the Physical Activity or Activities that will take place at the event
* the location (Place or Venue) in which it is taking place
* the Organiser of the event, which might be an individual or an organisation
* the Format of the event
* booking information, including price, attendance numbers and method of booking
* descriptive attributes, such as participation requirements or restrictions

Broadly, the descriptive attributes associated with an event might include any or 
all of the following:

* restrictions: e.g. on gender, age ranges, membership requirements
* suitability: e.g. fitness levels, experience, or age ranges
* pre-requisites: e.g. equipment or qualifications needed
* categorisation: e.g. intensity of session
* purpose: e.g. training, leisure, competition, etc
* structure: e.g. formal, informal

These attributes may use values taken from [Controlled Vocabularies](#controlled-vocabulary).

## Organisers

Events have __*organisers*__. An event organiser might be a person or an organisation. 
The organiser of an event is the person or organisation who arranged and/or hosts the event.

Examples of organisers might be coaches, or a local sports club.

Events may involve other named individuals or organisations. Examples might include named staff who will be participating 
in the event in addition to the main organiser. These are referred to as __*contributors*__.

Organisations might also be a __*funder*__ of an event: supporting or sponsoring an event through some form of 
financial contribution.

In addition to their names, some systems may have additional information about organisers and contributors. 
E.g. links to their web sites, photos, logos or contact details.

## Locations: Places and Venues

Events take place in a __*location*__. But, depending on the activity, the location 
may be defined to different levels of precision. For example:

* A gym class may take place in a leisure centre at a specific address or other precisely defined location
* A cycling or walking event might start at a specific location, but will subsequently follow a route
* An exercise or running group might meet in an area of a local park, rather than at a specific address

In addition to this, data publishers will have different approaches for capturing location data.

Recognising this need for flexibility, this model proposes that a location can be specified as any of the 
following:

* a description, e.g. "Meet by the lake, in Victoria Park"
* an address
* a venue, such as a leisure centre, which might have an address and/or a latitude or longitude
* a facility within a larger venue, e.g. a football pitch which is part of a leisure centre

This specification uses __*Place*__ as a general concept to refer to both venues and facilities. 

The concept of Place therefore covers general outdoor areas such as parks, event venues (e.g. a Leisure centre) 
and facilities within a venue (e.g. a squash court, running track, etc). Facilities are contained in Places.

Places may have additional descriptive properties, for example:

* a name
* an address and/or geographic co-ordinates
* opening hours
* a list of __*equipment*__ that is available for people to use at that location

To help distinguish between equipment and facilities: facilities will be fixed features of a location, e.g. 
squash courts or a walking trail; equipment will be items like table tennis tables that may be moved around 
a facility.

## Format

**[Issue 13](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/13)**: Format or Programme?

Events are often organised and run in a variety of different ways. This tailoring 
might include adjusting the activity to a particular type of participant, demographic. 
Or it could include running the event in a particular style, e.g. with a fixed routine 
or sequence of activities.

A __*Format*__ describes a method of carrying out a Physical Activity. Some formats of are very loosely defined. 
While others are more structured and may be run to a specific agenda or in a particular style.

Formats are often associated with branding or marketing that helps participants understand more about what they 
can expect from an event of that format. Formats might be offered or overseen by specific organisations

Examples of formats include:

* Les Mills BodyPump
* Learn to Row, from British Rowing
* Back to Netball, from England Netball

Formats provide another means of tagging or describing Events to help describe them to 
participants. When participants are looking for opportunities they may be interested in 
discovering Events based on either the general activity (e.g. Running) or a specific 
programme (Back to Netball).

## Activity Opportunities

Not all opportunities to be physically activity are organised Events. Some opportunities are self-directed 
for example: 

* following a designated walking route
* using a permanent (or temporary) orienteering course
* going for a ride on a mountain bike trail

The common elements here is that facilities are provided for use at a time of the participants choosing 
(within limits of opening hours or availability), rather than at a time or schedule specified by the 
organiser.

However many of the other aspects of describing an [Event](#event) are applicable to describing this 
type of opportunity. For example:

* they will involve one or more Physical Activities, e.g. mountain biking
* take place in a location, e.g. "Victoria Park Mountain Bike Trail"
* have other descriptive attributes, such as suitability for particular types of participants, fitness levels, etc.

In this specification this type of self-guided activities will be referred to as __*Activity Opportunities*__.

## Controlled Vocabulary

As described in the previous sections, Events may be categorised or tagged with additional properties 
that help describe it to participants. Publishing this information as structured data, rather than as 
a simple summary or event description can help create better discovery tools. 

For example an application might allow a user to filter a list of Events based on their suitability 
for specific age ranges, ability levels, etc.

It can be useful to publish __*Controlled Vocabularies*__ that provide lists of values or __*Terms*__ 
for these   properties.

Activity Lists are another example of where a controlled vocabulary is used to help organise 
opportunity data.

Systems publishing opportunity data might also openly publish their controlled vocabularies to help 
users of their data to use and understand it.

Reusing controlled vocabularies across the sector can help users integrate data that comes from different 
systems.

Like Activity Lists, other controlled vocabularies that support the publication of opportunity data 
will be published and shared according to the W3C [[SKOS]] standard.

<div class="note">
Systems that publish and use opportunity data will not be required to use fixed set of controlled 
vocabularies. This specification just outlines how they can be publish and shared. But, similar to 
Activity Lists, convergence on standardised controlled vocabulary might be useful for the physical 
activity sector. 
</div>

# Data Model

The data model described in the following sections reuses existing standards and vocabularies which 
have then been extended to cover the additional requirements needs to support the publication of 
opportunity data.

The Simple Knowledge Organisation System ([[SKOS]]) is a W3C standard for publishing taxonomies and 
category schemes. It can be used to help describe Activity Lists, Physical Activities and 
other Controlled Vocabularies

Schema.org [[SCHEMA-ORG]] provides an existing well-used and documented data model for publishing 
data to the web. It provides an existing model for describing Events, Organisations, People, and 
Places. 

Both standards are widely used, and can be used to publish data in a variety of structured formats, including 
[[JSON-LD]]. 

The __*Open Active Vocabulary*__ is a custom vocabulary designed to support the publication of 
opportunity data. It defines a number of new terms that extend SKOS and Schema.org to cover additional 
requirements.

## Namespaces

The rest of this specification make use of the following namespaces:

<dl>
<dt>`schema:`</dt>
<dd>`http://schema.org/`</dd>
<dt>`skos:`</dt>
<dd>`http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#`</dd>
<dt>`oa:`</dt>
<dd>`TBC`</dd>
</dl>

**[Issue 18](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/18)**: Create namespace for OA custom terms.

## Data Model Overview

The following table provides a high-level summary of how the concepts introduced in the previous sections map to 
definitions in SKOS, Schema.org and the Open Active Vocabulary.

## Describing Events (<code>schema:Event</code>)

The Schema.org [`schema:Event`](https://schema.org/Event) type aligns with the 
definition of Event as given in this specification. 

Schema.org defines a number of properties and relationships allow an Event to be described to 
different levels of details.

The following table illustrates how the essential aspects of describing an event 
map to existing Schema.org properties.

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Aspect</th>
    <th>Properties</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Description</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>[`schema:name`](https://schema.org/name)</li>
          <li>[`schema:url`](https://schema.org/url)</li>
          <li>[`schema:description`](https://schema.org/description)</li>
          <li>[`schema:image`](https://schema.org/image)</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>URL, description and representative images can be associated with any 
      Schema.org type</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Time</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>[`schema:startDate`](https://schema.org/startDate)</li>
          <li>[`schema:endDate`](https://schema.org/endDate)</li>
          <li>[`schema:duration`](https://schema.org/duration)</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>Can be specified as a [`schema:Date`](https://schema.org/Date) or
      [`schema:DateTime`](https://schema.org/DateTime) giving flexibility in precision.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Location</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>[`schema:location`](https://schema.org/location)</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>There is flexibility in precision here as the location can be a 
[`schema:Place`](https://schema.org/Place) with a fully described geographic location 
and/or address. A [`schema:PostalAddress`](https://schema.org/PostalAddress) for systems 
that only capture addresses, or just as [`schema:Text`](https://schema.org/Text): "In the park, near the lake"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Organiser</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>[`schema:organizer`](https://schema.org/organizer)</li>
          <li>[`schema:contributor`](https://schema.org/contributor)</li>
        </ul>
      <td>An organizer can be an [`schema:Organization`](https://schema.org/Organization) or 
      a [`schema:Person`]((https://schema.org/Person). These support additional descriptive 
      properties. Contributor, e.g. named staff or helpers can also be included</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

In addition to these properties, some custom terms are required to describe the activities that will take place in an 
Event and categorise it in various ways. These are covered in the following sections.

### Describing Event schedules

<div class="note">
There is a discussion under way in the Schema.org community to extend their model to cover recurring events. The [proposal](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1457) 
is to add a new `schema:schedule` property that will refer to a [recurrence rule](http://www.kanzaki.com/docs/ical/rrule.html) as defined in the iCalendar specification.  
this specification will be updated to refer to that property.
</div>

**[Issue 2](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/2)**: Schema.org support for recurring events

### Describing Participation Requirements & Restrictions

<div class="note">
This area is still under definition, see the issues linked below for discussion. Feedback and suggestions are welcomed.
</div>

**[Issue 3](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/3)**: Define additional 
event properties

**[Issue 4](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/4)**: Decide how to publish controlled vocabularies

Draft proposal is to define a number of new properties:

* `oa:activity` -- to refer to the Physical Activities related to an event
* `oa:ageSuitability` -- age range for the event. Alternatively use [`schema:typicalAgeRange`](https://schema.org/typicalAgeRange) but this doesn't allow use of a controlled vocabulary

## Describing Locations (<code>schema:Place</code>)

Schema.org takes a flexible approach towards defining the values for the [`schema:location`](https://schema.org/location) property 
for a [`schema:Event`](https://schema.org/Event). 

For example a [`location`](https://schema.org/location) can be defined as: 

* a simple textual description
* a [`schema:PostalAddress`](https://schema.org/PostalAddress) 
* a more fully defined [`schema:Place`](https://schema.org/Place) or one of its sub-types such as a [`schema:CivicStructure`](https://schema.org/CivicStructure) or [`schema:EventVenue`](https://schema.org/EventVenue)

Where a `schema:Place` is used, then there are additional properties that can be used to provide more information 
about that location

    </tr>
  </tbody>   
</table>

## Describing Organisers (<code>schema:Person</code> and <code>schema:Organization</code>)

The [`schema:Person`](https://schema.org/Person) and [`schema:Organization`](https://schema.org/Organization) share 
some common descriptive properties:

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Aspect</th>
    <th>Properties</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Description</td>
      <td>
        <ul>
          <li>[`schema:name`](https://schema.org/name)</li>
          <li>[`schema:url`](https://schema.org/url)</li>
          <li>[`schema:description`](https://schema.org/description)</li>
          <li>[`schema:image`](https://schema.org/image)</li>
          <li>[`schema:photo`](https://schema.org/photo)</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>URL, description and representative images can be associated with any 
      Schema.org type</td>
    </tr>    
  </tbody>   
</table>

## Describing Activity Lists (<code>skos:ConceptScheme</code>) and Physical Activity (<code>skos:Concept</code>)

Activities may be best described using a controlled vocabulary. [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) defines an existing standard data 
model that will allow:

* activities to be organised into hierarchies to capture broader-narrow relationships, 
e.g. "Martial Arts" and "Judo"
* activities to be related to one another
* the capturing of standard terms and codes used for indexing data, as well as alternate 
spellings to support discovery

Schema.org allows controlled vocabularies to be referenced as "[External Enumerations](https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/ExternalEnumerations)". 
This will allow standard terms for categories to be related to lists of activities published by 
individual publishers or as standards across the sector.

## Describing Formats (<code>skos:Concept</code>)

**[Issue 13](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/13)**: Should we use Format or Programme?

**[Issue 9](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/9)**: what attributes do we need to capture about Programmes?

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Aspect</th>
    <th>Properties</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Description</td>
      <td>
        <ul>

          <li>[`schema:url`](https://schema.org/url)</li>
          <li>[`schema:description`](https://schema.org/description)</li>
          <li>[`schema:image`](https://schema.org/image)</li>
          <li>[`schema:photo`](https://schema.org/photo)</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>URL, description and representative images can be associated with any 
      Schema.org type</td>
    </tr>    
  </tbody>   
</table>

## Describing Activity Opportunities (<code>oa:ActivityOpportunity</code>)

As defined in this specification an [Activity Opportunity](#activity-opportunity) is similar to an Event, except without the 
properties to describe a time at which it will take place.

The `oa:ActivityOpportunity` type will be used to represent these opportunities. The section on [Describing Events](#describing-events) also 
applies to describing Activity Opportunities.

## Extending the Model

The previous sections described how to publish opportunity data using a combination of existing and new vocabularies. 
But this approach may not address every requirement. Specific applications may need custom extensions and the community may want to 
revise or improve the core model in future.

With this in mind, this section briefly outlines an approach to handling extensions and revisions to this model.

Firstly, where SKOS or Schema.org define additional properties that are not referenced in this specification, then data publishers are 
free to use them. For example an application may wish to share reviews of events, places or clubs. The [`schema:review`](https://schema.org/review) property 
and related model can be used for this purpose, without requiring revisions to the Open Active Vocabulary.

This specification defines only loose conformance criteria, in the form of recommended properties. Consumers of opportunity data 
should be liberal in what they accept from data publishers, to allow the use of additional properties in this way. Over time this specification may 
be revised to reference more of these properties if and when they become widely used.

Secondly there may be a need to define new vocabulary relevant to broad needs of the open active community. An example is the need to 
support publication of data related to event booking. This may require revisions to this specification, e.g. to support the sharing of 
pricing and related information, in addition to an API specification to support bookings.
 
Finally, there may be a need for new vocabulary to support the needs for specific applications or user communities. For example there may be 
a need for a standard way to describe the characteristics of cycle tracks or orienteering trails. These extensions might be included in this 
data model or may be better described in other custom vocabularies, or even proposed as extensions to Schema.org.

Regardless of the type of extension, this activity can continue to be co-ordinated within the Open Active Community Group which can provide 
a ongoing forum for this type of standardisation activity.
