    <section id='abstract'>
This specification provides a common reference model for opportunity data. It 
introduces a high-level data model describing the key concepts relevant to 
publishing data about opportunities for people to engage in physical activity. 
This includes descriptions of the activities, as well as the events and locations 
in which they take place.

As a conceptual data model it provides a common reference point for other 
specifications and outputs of the OpenActive community group. The model may 
also be useful in guiding the development of both new and existing 
booking systems and applications that consume opportunity data.

The conceptual model is mapped to the types and properties defined by 
[Schema.org](https://schema.org), which provides a useful existing framework 
upon which the OpenActive Community Group can build.
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'>
The purpose of this document is to represent an early draft to prompt feedback. 
It will evolve based on discussion within the community.

Contributions to this document are not only welcomed but are actively solicited and 
should be made via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues) 
and pull requests. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data).

# Introduction

The [W3C Openactive Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/openactive/) was 
established with the objective of facilitating the sharing and use of 
physical activity data. This data is currently largely closed. Open publishing of this 
data has enormous potential to increase people's participation in physical activities.

## Categories of Physical Activity Data

There are several different categories of data that relevant to physical activities. 
This data covers different parts of [the data spectrum](http://theodi.org/data-spectrum) 
and is represented in the following diagram.

    <figure>
      ![](images/opportunity-data.png)
      <figcaption>Types of physical activity data</figcaption>
    </figure>

Some of this data is shared data. It can only be accessed by 
specific people or groups, under terms and conditions that define how and when 
it can be accessed and used. This shared data includes personal data about 
people taking part in activities and participation data that describes how people have 
been involved in previous events. 

Some of this data can be open data. This includes all of the data that 
describes:

* the location in which an activity or event takes place, along with any facilities available
* the details of the event itself, e.g. when it will take place, restrictions 
on attendance, costs, etc
* any related information, e.g. about the format of the event, its organiser, etc

Collectively this is known as "opportunity data".

## Scope of this Specification

This specification provides a common reference model for opportunity data. This 
reflects the goal of [the OpenActive project](https://www.openactive.io/) which 
is to encourage the open publishing and reuse of data that can help people 
become more active.

# Key Concepts

## Activities

An __Activity__ is an exercise, sport or other form of bodily movement 
that involves physical effort. Activities will normally have a well-understood, 
dictionary definition.

Examples of activities include walking, running and cycling. Sporting activities 
would include rubgy, football and tennis.

Activities can often be grouped together in different ways. For example Judo, 
Karate and Kendo are all more specific examples of the broader Martial Arts 
activity.

Activities may have additional information associated with them. For example a 
sporting activity might be overseen by an governing body or federation.

Activities may also be recognised by different bodies. In the UK certain 
activities are recognised as suitable for educational assessments, while others 
may be recognised by funding bodies like Sport England.

## Programmes

Activities are often organised and run in a variety of different ways. This 
includes tailoring the activity to a particular type of participant, demographic 
or fitness level. 

A __Programme__ is a particular way of carrying out a physical activity. 
There is often branding or marketing associated with the programme. This helps 
participants understand more about how the activity might be organised.

Some programmes are very loosely defined. While others are more structured and 
may be run to a specific agenda or in a particular style.

Examples of Programmes include:

* Spin Fit which is a means to participate in an activity called Spinning
* Buggy Fit, which is a Running activity tailored for parents of young children
* Zumba is a type of dance (or cardiac exercise) activity

When participants are looking for opportunities to take part in an activity they 
may be interested in either the general activity (e.g. Running) or a 
specific programme (Buggy Fit).

## Locations

Activities take place in a __Location__. However depending on the activity, location 
may be more or less tightly defined. For example:

* A gym class may take place in a leisure centre with an address or other precisely defined location
* A cycling or walking event might start at a specific location, but will follow a route
* An exercise or running group might meet in a local park, rather than at a specific address

## Events and Sessions

An __Event__ is an opportunity to take part in a physical activity. The activity 
may conform to a particular programme, and takes place at a specified date, time 
and location.

Some Events are one-off occurences. For example a fun run organised by a local group 
may run as a one-off event on a particular date. Other events take place 
on a regular recurring schedule.

In order to simplify terminology we recommend the use of the term "Event" to 
broadly cover individual occurences and regularly occuring activities. Where 
there is a need to disambiguate, we suggest using "*Session*" to refer to an individual 
event taking place at a specific date and time.

A weekly gym class provides a useful example of this distinction. As an Event the 
class takes place on a regular schedule, e.g. every Tuesday evening. There is 
a specific instance of that event taking place next Tuesday at 6pm. We would refer 
to the latter as a session.

Regardless of whether an event takes place once or to a regular schedule, there 
is a common set of information that can describe them, e.g:

* the Location in which it is taking place
* the Activity being carried out and the Programme being following
* the Organiser of the event, which might be an individual or an organisation
* other descriptive attributes including any associated price, attendance numbers, 
suitability for a particular audience, method of booking, etc.

# Mapping to Schema.org

Schema.org provides an existing well-used and documented data model for publishing 
data to the web. It can be used in a variety of use cases including marking up 
web pages and publishing data in more structured formats like JSON-LD.

The following sections outline how the concepts important to publishing 
opportunity data can be described using Schema.org classes and properties.

Where Schema.org does not provide necessary types and/or properties to describe 
all aspects of opportunity data, we will define new terms using their existing 
extension mechanism.

These extensions will be defined in this document and other supporting 
specifications.

## Events and Sessions (<code>Event</code>)

Schema.org [`Event`](https://schema.org/Event) type aligns with the 
definition of Event in this specification. A number of properties are provided 
that allow an [`Event`](https://schema.org/Event) to be described to a different 
levels of detail. 

An [`Event`](https://schema.org/Event) can also be related to a number of 
other types that help to capture the requirements for physical activities.

The following table illustrates how the essential aspects of describing an event 
map to existing Schema.org properties.

### Recurring Events

TODO

**[Issue 2](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/2): Schema.org doesn't handle recurring events**

### Describing Participation Requirements & Restrictions

**[Issue 3](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/3): Define additional 
event properties.**

**[Issue 4](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/4): Decide how to publish controlled vocabularies**

These are all broadly categories that help to describe an Event:

* Restrictions: e.g. gender, age, membership restrictions
* Suitability: e.g. level of fitness, experience 
* Pre-requisites: e.g. membership, equipment needed
* Categorisation: e.g. intensity of session, activities involved, programme followed

## Location (<code>Place</code> and <code>EventVenue</code>)

Schema.org takes a flexible approach towards defining the [`location`](https://schema.org/location) 
for an [`Event`](https://schema.org/Event). This ranges from simply textual descriptions through 
to more structured representations.

For example a [`location`](https://schema.org/location) can be defined as a 
[PostalAddress](https://schema.org/PostalAddress) or a more fully defined [Place](https://schema.org/Place), 
e.g. a [CivicStructure](https://schema.org/CivicStructure) or [EventVenue](https://schema.org/EventVenue).

        </ul>
      </td>

      <td>The [OpeningHoursSpecification](https://schema.org/OpeningHoursSpecification) provides 
      some support for describing when a location can be used</td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

**[Issue 5](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/5): decide how to model venue facilities**

## Activity (<code>PhysicalActivity</code>)

Activities may be best described using a controlled vocabulary. 
[SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) defines an existing standard data 
model that will allow:

* activities to be organised into hierarchies to capture broader-narrow relationships, 
e.g. "Martial Arts" and "Judo"
* activities to be related to one another
* the capturing of standard terms and codes used for indexing data, as well as alternate 
spellings to support discovery

Schema.org allows controlled vocabularies to be referenced as "[External Enumerations](https://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/ExternalEnumerations)". 
This will allow standard terms for categories to be related to lists of activities published by 
individual publishers or as standards across the sector.

**[Issue 6](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/6): How do we declare which controlled vocabularies we are using in a dataset?**

**[Issue 7](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/7): Can we use [PhysicalActivity](https://health-lifesci.schema.org/PhysicalActivity) and a  
[PhysicalActivityCategory](https://health-lifesci.schema.org/PhysicalActivityCategory) types?**

**[Issue 8](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/8): collect and publish [more example data about activity lists](https://github.com/openactive/w3c-cg-example-data/tree/master/activity-lists)**

## Programmes

Whereas Activities are best described using a controlled vocabulary, Programmes are 
likely to be more free-form.

**[Issue 9](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/9): what attributes do we need to capture about Programmes?**
