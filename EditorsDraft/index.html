    <section id='abstract'>
This specification introduces a data model to support the publication of data describing 
opportunities for people to engage in physical activities ("opportunity data"). This model 
covers description of activities, as well as the events and locations in which they take place. 

The specification is intended to support the publication of opportunity data as open data 
for anyone to access, use and share. It will also guide reusers of opportunity data, 
introducing them to the key concepts relevant to that sector.

The model may also be useful in guiding the development of both new and existing booking 
systems and applications that consume opportunity data.

The specification is an output of the [Openactive Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/openactive/) 
and serves as a common reference point for other specifications and outputs of that activity.

The data model introduced in this document has been mapped to existing standards and vocabularies, including 
SKOS ([[SKOS]]) and the Schema.org ([[SCHEMA-ORG]]) types and properties. 

This existing work provides a useful existing framework around which the 
[Openactive Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/openactive/) can build custom data standards.
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'>
The purpose of this document is to represent an early draft to prompt feedback. 
It will evolve based on discussion within the community.

Contributions to this document are not only welcomed but are actively solicited and 
should be made via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues) 
and pull requests. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data).

    <section class="informative">
# Introduction

The [W3C Openactive Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/openactive/) was 
established with the objective of facilitating the sharing and use of 
physical activity data. This data is currently largely closed. Open publishing of this 
data has enormous potential to increase people's participation in physical activities.

## Categories of Physical Activity Data

There are several different categories of data that relevant to physical activities. 
This data covers different parts of [the data spectrum](http://theodi.org/data-spectrum) 
and is represented in the following diagram.

    <figure>
      ![](images/opportunity-data.png)
      <figcaption>Types of physical activity data</figcaption>
    </figure>

Some of this data is shared data. It can only be accessed by 
specific people or groups, under terms and conditions that define how and when 
it can be accessed and used. This shared data includes personal data about 
people taking part in activities and participation data that describes how people have 
been involved in previous events. 

Some of this data can be open data. Open data is data that anyone can access, use and share. 
All of the following types of data can be published as open data:

* descriptions and lists of physical activities 
* details of the locations and venues at which activities or events takes place
* the facilities available at those locations
* the details of event involving physical activities e.g. when and where they will take place, restrictions 
on attendance, costs, etc
* any related information, e.g. about the format of the event, its organisers, etc

Collectively this is known as __*opportunity data*__.

## Requirements

This specification has been developed to meet a broad set of requirements.

### Support all types of opportunity data

As described in the previous section, opportunity data covers a variety of different types of 
information including data on venues, activities and events. The specification should support 
publication of all of these different types of data

### Support discovery of opportunities

The aims of OpenActive project is to encourage people to be more physically active. This means 
that this specification should focus on the data that will help people discover these 
opportunities. 

### Support all physical activities

The specification should be inclusive and support sharing of opportunity data about 
all types of physical activities, not just sports.

### Allow sharing of activity lists 

At present the physical activity sector does not have a standard list of physical activities. 
The specification should allow data providers to share the lists they have and support the 
sector in moving towards a standardised list of physical activities

### Support variety of sources

Opportunity data is collected and held in a variety of different tools, platforms and websites. 
There is variation in the amount of detail held about individual events so the specification must 
provide flexibility to share what data is currently available, whilst guiding activity providers 
towards additional useful data to collect about events.

### Be agnostic to formats and APIs

Reflecting the wide variety of tools and platforms in use, and also that the sector is at an 
early stage in sharing its data more widely, this specification should not prescribe specific 
data formats or APIs. Ideally opportunity data could be published as JSON, XML, CSV or other formats.

### Create an extensible framework

This specification should support extensions to allow it to be customised and revised to meet future 
requirements, as well as needs of specific communities of data publisher and consumer.

## Scope

This specification defines a data model for opportunity data. This reflects the goal of 
[the OpenActive project](https://www.openactive.io/) whose aim is to 
encourage the publishing and reuse of open data that might help people to become 
more active.

The following items are therefore out of scope for this specification:

* booking and related activities, e.g. availability, booking process and membership packages 
* participation data, e.g. statistics on attendance
* personal information, demographics and other information about event participants 
* APIs for publishing and discovering opportunity data

The [Openactive Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/openactive/) may produce 
additional specifications that address these areas.

## Structure of this document

This specification is divided into two main sections:

1. **Introduction** - provides a broad definition of opportunity data and goals for this specification
2. **Key Concepts** - describes the key types of resources relevant to opportunity data, along with their relationships and common attributes
3. **Data Model** - a data model that maps the key concepts to some standard vocabularies

# Key Concepts

This section introduces the high-level data model for opportunity data. This includes a 
description of the:

* the resources that are relevant to opportunity data, e.g. places, events, activities, etc
* the relationships between those resources
* the main attributes that help to describe those resources, e.g. names, dates, etc

The model also helps to provide definitions of key terms that are used throughout this 
specification.

## Data Model Diagram

This diagram illustrates the resources and relationships that are introduced in the following sections.

## Physical Activities

A __*Physical Activity*__ is an exercise, sport or other form of bodily movement 
that involves physical effort. Physical activities will usually have a well-understood, 
dictionary definition.

Examples of Physical Activities include walking, running, cycling, rugby, football and tennis

Activities should have a name. They might also be associated with one of more synonyms 
that provide alternative names for that activity. E.g. "Soccer" is a synonym 
for "Football". This additional information may be useful to help improve search engines and 
improve data collection.

Physical Activities may also have additional information associated with them. 
For example a sporting activity might be overseen by a governing body or federation.

Physical Activities might also be recognised by different bodies. In the UK certain 
activities are recognised as suitable for educational assessments, while others 
may be recognised by funding bodies like Sport England.

An __*Activity List*__ describes a set of Physical Activities. An Activity List may be a 
simple list of activity names. But an Activity List might also capture additional information. 
A common requirement is to describe relationships between Physical Activities.

One method of grouping activities is to define "broader" and "narrower" relationships.
For example Judo, Karate and Kendo are all more specific examples of the broader activity of 
"Martial Arts".

 * Martial Arts
  * Karate
  * Kendo
  * Judo

This type of grouping could also be used to describe the disciplines associated with 
Physical Activities. For example olympic and open water swimming.

An Activity List might also group Physical Activities into collections. For example 
swimming, water aerobics, and water polo might all be classified as "Water Sports".
Water polo and football might also be grouped into a collection of "Team Sports".

 * Team Sports
  * Football
  * Water Polo
 * Water Sports
  * Swimming
  * Water Aerobics
  * Water Polo

An Activity List may include any number of collections of Physical Activities. As shown in the 
example above, an individual Physical Activity might be present in more than one grouping. 

Some systems may choose to use grouping and hierarchical relationships between 
Physical Activities to help people find opportunities to be active. For example 
a search engine might offer users results for all types of Martial Art, or for Karate specifically.

<div class="note">
The proposed model for Activity Lists is based on the [[SKOS]] standard for publishing controlled 
vocabularies.
</div>

<div class="note">
It is not a requirement that systems store, publish or use relationships between 
Physical Activities. A system may choose to treat Physical Activities as simple tags 
or categories associated with Events. Other systems may define a fixed list of 
Physical Activities that are used as a controlled vocabulary to guides user input 
and data collection. Others may adopt a more complex hierarchical approach.
</div>

<div class="note">
<p>__Developing a standard activity list__</p>
<p>This specification doesn't place any requirements on how applications manage 
or use Physical Activities or Activity Lists. There is no requirement that applications that 
implement this specification should adopt a single standardised list, 
or agree on standard groupings. The intention here is to just capture a useful model that can represent the variety of data 
currently in use.
</p>
<p>However there will be benefits to the physical activity sector in developing a 
standard list of Physical Activities to improve discovery, reporting, etc. Defining that list is 
outside the scope of this specification.
</div>

## Events

An __*Event*__ is an opportunity to take part in a Physical Activity. Events take place at a 
specific location (see below) at an agreed date and time.

Some Events are one-off occurrences. For example a fun run organised by a local group 
may run as a standalone event on a particular date. 

Other events take place on a regular __schedule__. For example a weekly gym class may 
run every Wednesday evening at 7pm. While a local walking club might meet on a Saturday 
morning once a month.

In order to simplify terminology we recommend the use of the term "Event" to 
refer to both individual occurrences and regularly occurring events. 

It is useful to publish data about both individual Events and those with recurring schedules. 
People looking for opportunities to be active will be interested in both specific questions 
("what can I do tomorrow") and more general information about scheduled activities.

Regardless of whether an event takes place only once or happens on a regular schedule, there 
is a range of additional information that may help describe the event to potential participants. 
This includes:

* the Physical Activity or Activities that will take place at the event
* the location (Place or Venue) in which it is taking place
* the Organiser of the event, which might be a person or an organisation
* the Programme used to structure the event
* descriptive attributes, such as its suitability for specific age or weight ranges
* general category information to tag the event as suitable for certain fitness levels, intensity, etc
* booking information, including price, attendance numbers and method of booking

<div class="note">
<p>There are a variety of ways to categorise and describe events. This includes restrictions on attendance, 
aspect of suitability for different audiences and fitness levels, and a mixture of pre-requisites such as the 
need for certain qualifications, membership or equipment.
</p>
<p>
The initial version of this specification prioritises capturing the essential elements of describing an event. The 
structured information about time, place and activity is supplemented with some basic descriptive properties. 
This also includes the ability to add "tags" to an event to capture a variety of categorisation elements. Future 
versions of this specification will use experience working with real-world data to decide the best approach of 
formalising these categories.
</p>
</div>

## Organisers (Persons and Organizations)

Events have __*organisers*__. An event organiser might be a __*Person*__ or an __*Organization*__. 
The organiser of an event is the person or organisation who arranged and/or hosts the event.

Examples of organisers might be coaches, or a local sports club.

Events may involve other named individuals or organisations. Examples might include named staff who will be participating 
in the event in addition to the main organiser. These are referred to as __*contributors*__.

In addition to their names, some systems may have additional information about organisers and contributors. 
E.g. links to their web sites, photos, logos or contact details.

<div class="note">
<p>__Applications should not publish personal data without permission__</p>
<p>
This specification provides a data model for publishing information about individual people, e.g. coaches, 
volunteers, etc. However applications should respect privacy and data protection laws and must not publish 
data about individuals without their consent.
</p>
<p>
The ability to publish this type of data has been included because event organisers often choose to publicly 
share some information about themselves to help advertise an event. E.g. their name and some background on 
their qualifications or experience. But this information should not be published as open data without getting the 
consent of the individual concerned.
</p>
</div>

## Places

Events take place in a __*location*__. But, depending on the activity, the location 
may be defined to different levels of precision. For example:

* A gym class may take place in a leisure centre at a specific address or other precisely defined location
* A cycling or walking event might start at a specific location, but will subsequently follow a route
* An exercise or running group might meet in an area of a local park, rather than at a specific address

In addition to this, data publishers will have different approaches for capturing location data.

Recognising this need for flexibility, this model proposes that a location can be specified as any of the 
following:

* a description, e.g. "Meet by the lake, in Victoria Park"
* an address
* a venue, such as a leisure centre, which might have an address and/or a latitude or longitude
* a facility within a larger venue, e.g. a football pitch which is part of a leisure centre

This specification uses __*Place*__ as a general concept to refer to all types of locations, venues and facilities. 

The concept of Place therefore covers general outdoor areas such as parks, event venues (e.g. a Leisure centre) 
and facilities within a venue (e.g. a squash court, running track, etc). Facilities are contained in Places.

Places may have additional descriptive properties, for example:

* a name
* an address and/or geographic coordinates
* opening hours
* a list of __*equipment*__ that is available for people to use at that location

To help distinguish between equipment and facilities: facilities will be fixed features of a location, e.g. 
squash courts or a walking trail; equipment will be items like table tennis tables that may be moved around 
a facility.

## Programmes

Events are often organised and run in a variety of different ways. This tailoring 
might include adjusting the activity to a particular type of participant, demographic. 
Or it could include running the event in a particular style, e.g. with a fixed routine 
or sequence of activities.

A __*Programme*__ describes a method of carrying out a Physical Activity. Some programmes are very loosely defined. 
While others are more structured and may be run to a specific agenda or in a particular style.

Programmes are often associated with branding or marketing that helps participants understand more about what they 
can expect from an event of that format. Formats might be offered or overseen by specific organisations

Examples of programmes include:

* Les Mills BodyPump
* Learn to Row, from British Rowing
* Back to Netball, from England Netball

Programmes provide another means of tagging or describing Events to help describe them to 
participants. When participants are looking for opportunities they may be interested in 
discovering Events based on either the general activity (e.g. Running) or a specific 
programme (Back to Netball).

## Activity Opportunities

Not all opportunities to be physically activity are organised Events. Some opportunities are self-directed 
for example: 

* following a designated walking route
* using a permanent (or temporary) orienteering course
* going for a ride on a mountain bike trail

The common elements here is that facilities are provided for use at a time of the participants choosing 
(within limits of opening hours or availability), rather than at a time or schedule specified by the 
organiser.

However many of the other aspects of describing an [Event](#event) are applicable to describing this 
type of opportunity. For example:

* they will involve one or more Physical Activities, e.g. mountain biking
* take place in a location, e.g. "Victoria Park Mountain Bike Trail"
* have other descriptive attributes, such as suitability for particular types of participants, fitness levels, etc.

In this specification this type of self-guided activities will be referred to as __*Activity Opportunities*__.

# Data Model

The data model described in the following sections reuses existing standards and vocabularies which 
have then been extended to cover the additional requirements needs to support the publication of 
opportunity data.

The Simple Knowledge Organisation System ([[SKOS]]) is a W3C standard for publishing taxonomies and 
category schemes. It can be used to help publish and organise Activity Lists and to describe 
Physical Activities.

Schema.org [[SCHEMA-ORG]] provides an existing well-used and documented data model for publishing 
data to the web. It provides an existing model for describing Events, Organisations, People, and 
Places. 

Both standards are widely used, and can be used to publish data in a variety of structured formats, including 
[[JSON-LD]]. 

The __[*Open Active Vocabulary*](https://www.openactive.io/ns/)__ is a custom vocabulary designed to support the publication of 
opportunity data. It defines a number of new terms that extend SKOS and Schema.org to cover additional 
requirements highlighted in this specification.

## Namespaces

The rest of this specification make use of the following namespaces:

<dl>
<dt>`dc:`</dt>
<dd>`http://purl.org/dc/terms/`</dd>
<dt>`schema:`</dt>
<dd>`http://schema.org/`</dd>
<dt>`skos:`</dt>
<dd>`http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#`</dd>
<dt>`oa:`</dt>
<dd>`https://www.openactive.io/ns/`</dd>
</dl>

<div class="note">
<p>
In the following sections all referenced terms have been qualified using their namespace prefix. This helps to highlight the 
source vocabulary in which they are defined. Terms are also linked to their definitions.
</p>
<p>
The examples in each section use [[JSON-LD]] syntax and make use of [the terms declared in the OpenActive Vocabulary](https://www.openactive.io/ns/#term-definitions). 
This feature of [[JSON-LD]] removes the need to use explicit namespace prefixes.

</div>

## Data Model Overview

The following table provides a high-level summary of how the concepts introduced in the previous sections map to 
definitions in SKOS, Schema.org and the Open Active Vocabulary.

## Identifying and Linking Resources

This specification adopts the same approach as Schema.org and encourages the use of URLs as unique identifiers for resources.

Information about Events, Places, Organizations and other types of resources should already have been published online to 
make that information accessible to users. Using existing URLs as identifiers avoids the need to define a new identifier 
scheme for resources described in opportunity data. 

There will generally be a single canonical URL for a resource, e.g. the homepage for an Organization or Place, or 
a public web page advertising an Event.

If there are several different URLs that may be used to identify a resource, it is recommended that systems use:

* a direct link to the resource that avoids redirects
* a stable link that will resolve to a public web page, accessible to both web browsers and applications
* a consistent link that will allow reusers to rely on the URL as an identifier, e.g. to merge in updated data

This specification provides two related properties for identifying resources:

* `@id` - is used to [assign a globally unique URI to a resource](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#node-identifiers). This may resolve to further machine-readable 
 information about the resource. When supplied, this URI should be stable and unchanging over time. Applications harvesting and 
 indexing opportunity data <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> use this as a unique identifier for the resource
* [`schema:url`](http://schema.org/url) - provides a link to a public web page about the resource. Further machine-readable metadata 
may be discoverable from that web page. Applications must be able to use this URL as a means for providing users with a link to more information 
 about a resource.

In short, the `@id` property provides a unique identifier while the `schema:url` provides a means to provide a link to 
a public web page about a resource. 

If applicable then publishers may choose to use the same URI for these two properties. If an `@id` property is not provided then 
applications <em class="rfc2119">MAY</em> choose to rely on the value of this property as a unique identifier.

The option to use two different URls is useful when there is a need to distinguish between a unique identifier and a 
public resource. For example a platform hosting opportunity data may need to assign a unique identifier to a resource 
that is separate to its public web page.

<pre class="example" title="Simple event description"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "id": "http://host.opportunity-data.com/id/12345"
  "url": "http://my-leisure-centre.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Tai chi Class"
}
</code>
</pre>

In the above example the `@id` property provides a unique identifier across the hosting application. But the public URL for the 
Event uses a separate, customer-specific domain.

If a publisher has existing non-URI identifiers for a resource, e.g. a company or registration number for an Organization, then 
this can be provided using the [`schema:identifier`](http://schema.org/identifier) property.

## Required and Optional Properties

The following sections include more detail about the properties available to describe each type of resource. Some 
properties are considered to be essential to ensure the provision of a minimally useful set of information about each 
resource. These <em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em> properties must be provided.

All other properties are considered to be optional but it is <em class="rfc2119">RECOMMENDED</em> that they 
be provided where possible.

Data publishers <em class="rfc2119">MAY</em> include additional properties, e.g. from Schema.org or other vocabularies 
when helpful to describe their data. See the section on **Extending the Model** for more information.

Applications that consume opportunity data <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> ignore any properties that they don't 
understand. This allows data publishing practices within the sector to evolve as required.

## Describing Events (<code>schema:Event</code>)

The Schema.org [`schema:Event`](https://schema.org/Event) type corresponds to the definition of 
Event given earlier in this specification. The properties and relationships associated with the 
[`schema:Event`](https://schema.org/Event) type can all be used to describe events.

The following table illustrates how the essential aspects of describing an event map to 
existing Schema.org properties and/or properties defined in the OpenActive Vocabulary.

</table>

The following example shows a simple event description, including its start time and duration:

<pre class="example" title="Simple event description"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Tai chi Class",
  "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
  "attendeeInstructions": "Please wear trainers and comfortable clothing",
  "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
  "duration": "PT60M"
}
</code>
</pre>

This basic description can be improve by providing information about its location and organizer.

<pre class="example" title="Adding a venue and an organizer"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Tai chi Class",
  "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
  "attendeeInstructions": "Please wear trainers and comfortable clothing",
  "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
  "duration": "PT60M",
  "organizer": {
    "type": "Person",
    "url": "http://example.org/orgs/bristol-tai-chi",
    "name": "Bristol Tai Chi"  
  },
  "location": {
    "type": "Place",
    "name": "ExampleCo Gym",
    "address": {
      "type": "PostalAddress",
      "streetAddress": "1 High Street",
      "addressLocality": "Bristol",
      "postalCode": "BS1 4SD"
    }
  }  
}
</code></pre>

### Relating Events to Physical Activities

The [`oa:activity`](https://www.openactive.io/ns/#activity) property allows an event to be associated with one or more Physical Activities. It's simplest usage is as follows:

<pre class="example" title="Specifying activities"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Tai chi Class",
  "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
  "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
  "duration": "PT60M",
  "oa:activity": "Tai chi"
}
</code>
</pre>

This specifies that the event will involve Tai Chi. Multiple activities can be specified by using repeated values:

<pre class="example" title="Specifying multiple activities"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Tai chi Class",
  "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
  "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
  "duration": "PT60M",
  "activity": ["Tai chi", "Martial Arts", "Combat"]
}
</code>
</pre>

The Physical Activities used to describe an event may be drawn from a standard Activity List. In this case it is useful to make this clear in 
the opportunity data. In the following example the Physical Activity associated with the Event is shown as a structured value. This allows 
more information to be provided, including its identifier, its label and alternative labels, and the identifier of the Activity List from which 
it has been drawn:

<pre class="example" title="Using activities from an Activity List"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Tai chi Class",
  "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
  "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
  "duration": "PT60M",
  "activity": {
    "id": "http://example.org/activity-list#tai-chi",
    "type": "Concept",
    "prefLabel": "Tai chi",
    "altLabel": "Tai-chi",
    "inScheme": "http://example.org/activity-list"
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

Again, multiple activities can be specified by specifying an array of values.

### Categorising events

The [`oa:category`](https://www.openactive.io/ns/#category) property can be used to associate an Event with one or more tags that provide more detail about the event.

<pre class="example" title="Tagging an Event"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Tai chi Class",
  "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
  "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
  "duration": "PT60M",
  "category": ["Beginner", "Low intensity"]
}
</code>
</pre>

### Describing Event Suitability

There are a variety of ways in which the suitability of an event for specific audiences can be expressed. This includes specifying that 
an event is:

* suited for a specific age range
* suited for people within a specific height or weight rage
* restricted to a male, female or mixed audience

The following example illustrates how to indicate that an event it targeted as a specific age range (over 60s) but is open to a mixed 
audience:

<pre class="example" title="Age and gender example"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Tai chi Class",
  "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
  "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
  "duration": "PT60M",
  "ageRange": 60,
  "genderRestriction": "mixed"
}
</code>
</pre>

An Event involving a climbing activity might be limited to people within a specific age and/or weight range. The following example illustrates 
how to use these properties:

<pre class="example" title="Age and gender example"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Climbing adventure",
  "description": "A tree top climbing adventure",
  "startDate": "2017-03-22T10:00:00",
  "duration": "PT60M",
  "ageRange": 10,
  "heightRange": 1.4,
  "weightRange": "45-125",
  "genderRestriction": "mixed"
}
</code>
</pre>

### Adding programmes

Events can be associated with a Programme using the [`oa:programme`](https://www.openactive.io/ns/#programme) property. In its simplest form this allows the name of a Programme to be associated with an event:

<pre class="example" title="Tagging an Event"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Rowing Class",
  "description": "A rowing class for beginners",
  "startDate": "2017-04-01T08:00:00",
  "duration": "PT60M",
  "category": ["Beginner"],
  "programme": "Learn to Row"
}
</code>
</pre>

If more information about the programme is available, then this can be included by describing the Programme in a more structured way:

<pre class="example" title="Tagging an Event"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Rowing Class",
  "description": "A rowing class for beginners",
  "startDate": "2017-04-01T08:00:00",
  "duration": "PT60M",
  "category": ["Beginner"],
  "programme": {
    "name": "Learn to Row",
    "url": "https://www.britishrowing.org/go-rowing/learn-to-row/",
    "description": "Getting started in rowing couldn’t be easier!"
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

### Describing Scheduled events

<div class="note">
**Schema.org support for recurring events**

**[Issue 2](https://github.com/openactive/modelling-opportunity-data/issues/2)**: Schema.org support for recurring events

There is a discussion under way in the Schema.org community to extend their model to cover recurring events. The [proposal](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1457#issuecomment-286423792) 
is to add a new `schema:eventSchedule` property that will refer to a [recurrence rule](http://www.kanzaki.com/docs/ical/rrule.html) as defined in the iCalendar specification. The 
assumption is that this proposal will be expected and this specification will then recommend use of the `schema:eventSchedule` property. The following section is written on that basis but 
is subsequent to change.
</div>

The following example illustrates basic usage of the [`schema:eventSchedule`](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1457#issuecomment-286423792) property. The data describes 
a Tai Chi class that occurs every Weds at 7pm

<pre class="example" title="Adding an event schedule"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",

  "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
  "duration": "PT60M",
  "eventSchedule": {
     "type": "Schedule",
     "startDate": "2017-01-01",
     "endDate": "2017-12-31",
     "frequency": "weekly",
     "byDay": "http://schema.org/Wednesday",
     "startTime": "19:00",
     "endTime": "20:00"
  }

</pre>

### Describing event availability

Schema.org provides a couple of basic properties for describing the maximum ([`schema:maximumAttendeeCapacity`](http://schema.org/maximumAttendeeCapacity)) and remaining capacity ([`schema:remainingAttendeeCapacity`](http://schema.org/remainingAttendeeCapacity)) for an [`schema:Event`](https://schema.org/Event). 

These properties can be used to provide some basic availability information for scheduled events. These are illustrated in the following example which states that a Tai chi class can be attended by up to 20 people and that there are 4 spaces remaining.

<pre class="example" title="Basic event availability"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Tai chi Class",
  "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
  "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
  "duration": "PT60M",
  "maximumAttendeeCapacity": 20,
  "remainingAttendeeCapacity": 4
}
</code>
</pre>

### Indicating the status of an event

An [`schema:Event`](https://schema.org/Event) may occasionally be rescheduled or cancelled. Schema.org provides the [`schema:eventStatus`](http://schema.org/eventStatus) property for indicating the current status of an event.

The property can have several standardised values which are defined by the [`schema:EventStatusType`](http://schema.org/EventStatusType) enumeration. The property values should therefore be one of the following URIs:

* Cancelled: `http://schema.org/EventCancelled`
* Postponed: `http://schema.org/EventPostponed`
* Rescheduled: `http://schema.org/EventRescheduled`
* Scheduled: `http://schema.org/EventScheduled`

If the status property is not provided then applications should assume that a default "scheduled" status. The following example shows a Tai chi class that has been cancelled:

<pre class="example" title="A cancelled event"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Tai chi Class",
  "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
  "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
  "duration": "PT60M",
  "eventStatus": "http://schema.org/EventCancelled"
}
</code>
</pre>

## Describing Locations (<code>schema:Place</code> and <code>schema:PostalAddress</code>)

Schema.org takes a flexible approach towards defining the locations for an [`schema:Event`](https://schema.org/Event). 

The legal values for the [`schema:location`](https://schema.org/location) property include:

* a simple textual description
* a [`schema:PostalAddress`](https://schema.org/PostalAddress) 
* a more fully defined [`schema:Place`](https://schema.org/Place) or one of its sub-types such as a [`schema:CivicStructure`](https://schema.org/CivicStructure) or [`schema:EventVenue`](https://schema.org/EventVenue)

While all three forms are allowed by Schema.org, applications that are publish opportunity data <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> either
specify an [`schema:PostalAddress`](https://schema.org/PostalAddress) or a more details [`schema:Place`](https://schema.org/Place) description.


### Describing Addresses

Schema.org provides the following properties for publishing address data using the [`schema:PostalAddress`](https://schema.org/PostalAddress) type.

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Status</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>  
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:streetAddress`](https://schema.org/streetAddress)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em></td>
      <td>Street address</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:addressLocality`](https://schema.org/addressLocality)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em></td>
      <td>Town or other area</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:region`](https://schema.org/region)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em></td>
      <td>Region</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:postalCode`](https://schema.org/postalCode)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em></td>
      <td>Postcode</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>   
</table>

The following example shows how to markup a simple address:

<pre class="example" title="An Address">
<code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "PostalAddress",
  "streetAddress": "North Parade Road",
  "addressLocality": "Bath",
  "region": "Somerset",
  "postalCode": "BA2 4ET"
}
</code>
</pre>


### Describing Places

In order to provide additional information, e.g. the name of the location or its geographic co-ordinates, then the [`schema:Place`](https://schema.org/Place) 
type should be used instead.

The following table lists the properties that can be used to provide descriptions of a [`schema:Place`](https://schema.org/Place) 

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Status</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:url`](https://schema.org/url)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em></td>
      <td>A URL to a web page (or section of a page) that describes the Place</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:name`](https://schema.org/name)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em></td>
      <td>The name of the Place</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:description`](https://schema.org/description)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">RECOMMENDED</em></td>
      <td>A free text description of the Place</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:image`](https://schema.org/image)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">OPTIONAL</em></td>
      <td>An image or photo that depicts the place</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:address`](https://schema.org/address)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">RECOMMENDED</em></td>
      <td>The street address of the location, expressed as a [`schema:PostalAddress`](https://schema.org/PostalAddress). See the following section for more information on describing [`schema:PostalAddress`](https://schema.org/PostalAddress) resources</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:geo`](https://schema.org/geo)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">RECOMMENDED</em></td>
      <td>The geographic co-ordinates, specified as a latitude and longitude of a Place</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:containedInPlace`](https://schema.org/containedInPlace)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">OPTIONAL</em></td>
      <td>Indicates that this Place is part of a larger location. Can be used to allow, e.g. a pitch or other facility to be related to a parent location such as a Leisure Centre</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:containsPlace`](https://schema.org/containsPlace)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">OPTIONAL</em></td>
      <td>Relates a Place to other locations and facilities that it contains. Schema.org provides a specific type of Place, called a 
      [`schema:SportsActivityLocation`](https://schema.org/SportsActivityLocation) for describing facilities</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:telephone`](https://schema.org/telephone)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">OPTIONAL</em></td>
      <td>A contact telephone number for the location, e.g. for enquiries</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:openingHoursSpecification`](https://schema.org/openingHoursSpecification)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">OPTIONAL</em></td>
      <td>Specifies the opening hours of a location. The value of this property is a [`schema:OpeningHoursSpecification`](http://schema.org/OpeningHoursSpecification).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>   
</table>

This example illustrates a simple place description. Building on the previous example it adds the name, telephone number and website address for the leisure centre:

<pre class="example" title="Describing a leisure centre"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Place",
  "url": "http://www.better.org.uk/leisure-centre/banes/bath-sports-and-leisure-centre",
  "name": "Bath Sports and Leisure Centre",
  "address": {
      "type": "PostalAddress",
      "streetAddress": "North Parade Road",
      "addressLocality": "Bath",
      "region": "Somerset",
      "postalCode": "BA2 4ET"
  },
  "telephone": "+44 (0)1225 486905"    
}
</code></pre>

A more precise geographical location can be provided by adding a [`schema:geo`](https://schema.org/geo) property:

<pre class="example" title="Locating a leisure centre"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Place",
  "url": "http://www.better.org.uk/leisure-centre/banes/bath-sports-and-leisure-centre",
  "name": "Bath Sports and Leisure Centre",
  "address": {
      "type": "PostalAddress",
      "streetAddress": "North Parade Road",
      "addressLocality": "Bath",
      "region": "Somerset",
      "postalCode": "BA2 4ET"
  },
  "telephone": "+44 (0)1225 486905",
  "geo": {
    "latitude": "51.3816123",
    "longitude": "-2.3544367"
  }
}
</code></pre>

### Describing Facilities

Facilities available at a location can be expressed using the containment properties ([`schema:containedInPlace`](https://schema.org/containedInPlace) and [`schema:containsPlace`](https://schema.org/containsPlace)). The following example illustrates how to describe that a Leisure Centre includes a gym:

<pre class="example" title="Describing a leisure centre"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Place",
  "url": "http://www.better.org.uk/leisure-centre/banes/bath-sports-and-leisure-centre",
  "name": "Bath Sports and Leisure Centre",
  "address": {
      "type": "PostalAddress",
      "streetAddress": "North Parade Road",
      "addressLocality": "Bath",
      "region": "Somerset",
      "postalCode": "BA2 4ET"
  },
  "containsPlace": {
    "type": "SportsActivityLocation",
    "url": "http://www.better.org.uk/leisure-centre/banes/bath-sports-and-leisure-centre/gym",
    "name": "Gym"
  }    
}
</code></pre>

## Describing Organisers (<code>schema:Person</code> and <code>schema:Organization</code>)

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Applications should not publish personal data without permission</strong></p>
<p>
While the <a href="https://schema.org/Person"><code>schema:Person</code></a> type allows a variety of information to be published about a 
person, applications should not publish this information as open data without consent.
</p>
</div>

To describe the people and organisations involving in organising Events, Schema.org provides the [`schema:Person`](https://schema.org/Person) and [`schema:Organization`](https://schema.org/Organization) types.

Both of the types support a common set of properties that capture the basic information required for publishing opportunity data.

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Status</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:url`](https://schema.org/url)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">RECOMMENDED</em></td>
      <td>A URL to the homepage or other page about the organisation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:name`](https://schema.org/name)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em></td>
      <td>The name of the organisation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:description`](https://schema.org/description)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">OPTIONAL</em></td>
      <td>A description of the organisation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:logo`](https://schema.org/logo)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">OPTIONAL</em></td>
      <td>The logo of an organisation</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>   
</table>

The following example illustrates how to associate an [`schema:Organization`](https://schema.org/Organization) with an event:

<pre class="example" title="Specifying an organiser"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Event",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/events/1",
  "name": "Tai chi Class",
  "description": "A tai chi class intended for beginners",
  "startDate": "2017-03-22T20:00:00-05:00",
  "duration": "PT60M",
  "organizer": {
    "type": "Organization",
    "url": "http://example.org/clubs/1",
    "name": "Bath Tai Chi Club"    
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

## Describing Activity Lists (<code>skos:ConceptScheme</code>) and Physical Activity (<code>skos:Concept</code>)

List of Physical Activities are controlled vocabularies that can be published using the types and properties defined by the [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) standard. This will cover all the requirements [outlined in the concept model](#physical-activities), allowing:

* activities to be organised into hierarchies to capture broader-narrow relationships, e.g. "Martial Arts" and "Judo"
* sharing of alternative labels to support search and indexing
* the sharing of standard codes to support data integration

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Status</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>[`dc:title`](http://purl.org/dc/terms/title)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em></td>
      <td>Title of the Activity List</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`schema:description`](https://schema.org/description)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">RECOMMENDED</em></td>
      <td>Description of the activity list</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`dc:license`](http://purl.org/dc/terms/license)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">RECOMMENDED</em></td>
      <td>Reference to the license under which the activity list has been published</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>   
</table>

The following example illustrates the basic structure of an activity list:

<pre class="example" title="Publishing an activity list"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "ConceptScheme",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/activity-list",
  "title": "Activity List",
  "description": "An example activity list",
  "concepts": [{
    "type": "Concept",
    "prefLabel": "Martial Arts",
    "narrower": {
      "type": "Concept",
      "prefLabel": "Tai Chi"
    }    
  }]
}
</code>
</pre>

The `concepts` property used in the above example is defined in the JSON-LD context published as part of the Open Active Vocabulary.

### Describing Physical Activities

The following properties from the [[SKOS]] specification can be used to describe physical activities.

<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Status</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>[`skos:prefLabel`](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#prefLabel)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em></td>
      <td>Preferred label for referring to the physical activity. The preferred labels should be used when publishing data about the activities involved in an event.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`skos:altLabel`](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#altLabel)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">OPTIONAL</em></td>
      <td>Alternative labels for the physical activity</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`skos:inScheme`](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#inScheme)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">RECOMMENDED</em></td>
      <td>Refers to the Activity List in which this physical activity is defined.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`skos:broader`](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#broader)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">OPTIONAL</em></td>
      <td>Where an Activity List is organised as a hierarchy of activities, this property can be used to refer to a parent or broader term. E.g. "Martial Arts" is broader than "Tai Chi".</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`skos:narrower`](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#narrower)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">OPTIONAL</em></td>
      <td>Where an Activity List is organised as a hierarchy of activities, this property can be used to refer to a child or narrower term. E.g. "Tai Chi" is a narrower term of "Martial Arts"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>[`skos:notation`](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#notation)</td>
      <td><em class="rfc2119">OPTIONAL</em></td>
      <td>Provides a unique code or identifier for an activity</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>   
</table>

<pre class="example" title="Publishing an activity list"><code>
{
  "@context": "https://www.openactive.io/ns/oa.jsonld",
  "type": "Concept",
  "url": "http://www.example.org/activity-list#tai-chi",
  "prefLabel": "Tai Chi",
  "altLabel": "Tai-Chi",
  "inScheme": "http://www.example.org/activity-list"
}
</code>
</pre>

## Describing Activity Opportunities (<code>oa:ActivityOpportunity</code>)

As described earlier in this specification, an [Activity Opportunity](#activity-opportunity) is similar to an Event except it does not take 
place at a specific time: individual participants will decide when they will take part in the physical activity.

The [`oa:ActivityOpportunity`](https://www.openactive.io/ns/#ActivityOpportunity) type will be used to represent these opportunities. 

Information about Activity Opportunities can be published using the same set of properties that have been identified for [Describing Events](#describing-events-code-schema-event-code-).

However applications <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> not use the `schema:schedule`, `schema:startDate` and `schema:endDate` properties on this 
type of resource.

## Extending the Model

The previous sections described how to publish opportunity data using a combination of existing and new vocabularies. 
But this approach may not address every requirement. Specific applications may need custom extensions and the community may want to 
revise or improve the core model in future.

With this in mind, this section briefly outlines an approach to handling extensions and revisions to this model.

Firstly, where SKOS or Schema.org define additional properties that are not referenced in this specification, then data publishers are 
free to use them. For example an application may wish to share reviews of events, places or clubs. The [`schema:review`](https://schema.org/review) property 
and related model can be used for this purpose, without requiring revisions to the Open Active Vocabulary.

This specification defines only loose conformance criteria, in the form of recommended properties. Consumers of opportunity data 
should be liberal in what they accept from data publishers, to allow the use of additional properties in this way. Over time this specification may 
be revised to reference more of these properties if and when they become widely used.

Secondly there may be a need to define new vocabulary relevant to broad needs of the open active community. An example is the need to 
support publication of data related to event booking. This may require revisions to this specification, e.g. to support the sharing of 
pricing and related information, in addition to an API specification to support bookings.
 
Finally, there may be a need for new vocabulary to support the needs for specific applications or user communities. For example there may be 
a need for a standard way to describe the characteristics of cycle tracks or orienteering trails. These extensions might be included in this 
data model or may be better described in other custom vocabularies, or even proposed as extensions to Schema.org.

Regardless of the type of extension, this activity can continue to be co-ordinated within the Open Active Community Group which can provide 
an ongoing forum for this type of standardisation activity.
